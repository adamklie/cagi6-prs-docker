# Main pipeline for taking individual level gentypes in Plink bfile format and outputting predictions

# Run predataloader script to generate a feather file from all individuals

# Double check that the SNPs are the same ones as used in training (pay attention to alleles!)

# Make predictions using InSNPtion model
